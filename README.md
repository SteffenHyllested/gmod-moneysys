Extremely primitive money system for GMOD. Mainly made for me to practice data saving.
Adds an "ATM" entity, which allows you to move money from your personal balance onto your bank balance, and vice versa.
Uses imgui for 3D2D UI. There is currently no way to get more money, however you start with $100.
